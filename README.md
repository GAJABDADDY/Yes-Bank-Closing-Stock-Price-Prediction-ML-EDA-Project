# Yes-Bank-Closing-Stock-Price-Prediction-ML-EDA-Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the closing stock price of Yes Bank using machine learning models in Python. It involves data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to forecast the stock price.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection:** Obtaining historical stock price data for Yes Bank.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing and visualizing trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating relevant features such as moving averages, technical indicators, etc.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementing various ML algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting for prediction.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
- **Stock Price Prediction:** Using trained models to forecast the closing stock price of Yes Bank.
